# How It Works (Flow)

1. User sends /start command
   - Bot greets and checks if the user exists in the database.
   - If not, adds user based on Telegram info.

2. User is asked to upload two documents one by one:
   - ID Document
   - Car Document

3. For each document:
   - The document is saved in the local file + saved to the DB.
   - The file is processed with Mindee API to extract text. The extracted fields should be saved to the local cache with related document info.
   - The extracted fields are displayed to the user for confirmation (Yes/No).
   - On a "Yes" answer, the extracted fields should be saved to the DB from cache.

5. Any other message: 
   â†’ Passed to OpenAI for a smart reply.
